"""
Causal Actuation Engine — v7.4
Maps divergence field (from swarm/swarm_divergence_field.py) → corrective actions.

The closed loop:
  SwarmDivergenceField
    → ActuationSignal (direction + magnitude of corrective force)
      → ActuatorCommand (specific command to specific worker/node)
        → system dynamics update
          → new SwarmDivergenceField (feedback)

Key concept: corrective actions are CAUSAL interventions, not just config changes.
A causal intervention reshapes the causal manifold itself, not just parameters.
