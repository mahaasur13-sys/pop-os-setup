"""
Stability Feedback Controller — v7.4
Prevents oscillation collapse: ensures the system does not over-correct.

The oscillation problem:
  actuator applies correction → system responds →
  response triggers new correction → over-correct →
  oscillation / divergence collapse

The controller implements a damped feedback loop:
  observed_gain vs expected_gain → adaptive gain adjustment →
  oscillation detection → mode switch to dampen.

This is analogous to a PID controller's derivative term,
preventing the system from going into resonance.

    Damped feedback controller for the actuator layer.

    Monitors the error signal (actual_gain vs expected_gain) over time
    and detects oscillation patterns. When oscillation is detected,
    it transitions to a dampen mode that reduces control authority.

    The key shift from having no controller:
      No controller:     apply command → observe result → apply command →
                         → over-correction → oscillation collapse
      With controller:   apply command → observe result →
                         → detect oscillation → dampen → stable convergence

    Design constraints:
      - Damping should never go below 0.1 (system would be uncontrollable)
      - Adaptive gain converges to 1.0 when stable (full authority restored)
      - Oscillation detection uses a rolling window of gain observations
