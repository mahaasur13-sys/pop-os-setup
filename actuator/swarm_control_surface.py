Swarm Control Surface — v7.4
Maps global S_full (from distributed_tensor_alignment) → actuator command primitives.

This is the "control surface" through which the actuation layer
interfaces with the swarm runtime. It abstracts the physical act of
sending commands to workers as a unified interface.

Key concept:
  S_full is a metric (scalar). The control surface converts it into
  a control vector that can be applied to swarm dynamics.
