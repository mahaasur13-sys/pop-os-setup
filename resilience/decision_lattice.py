DecisionLattice v6.6 — Formal deterministic decision algebra.

Problem:
  GlobalControlArbiter has a priority cascade, but:
    - No formal proof of correctness
    - No deterministic algebra for conflict resolution
    - No verification that lattice is total/consistent

Solution:
  DecisionLattice provides a mathematically formal decision structure:
    - Determinism: same SystemState → same LatticeDecision (idempotent)
    - Completeness: every state produces a decision (no undefined states)
    - Conflict-freedom: no two actions in the output conflict
    - Priority soundness: higher-priority action always wins

The lattice is a TOTAL ORDER over all possible system states, with
formal proof annotations for each priority level.

Usage:
    lattice = DecisionLattice()
    state = SystemState.from_snapshot(snap, peers=["node-b", "node-c"])
    decision = lattice.decide(state)
    # decision.primary_action    — resolved PolicyAction
    # decision.secondary_actions — supporting actions
    # decision.lattice_path      — proof trace (list of rule names)
    # decision.conflicts_resolved — history of conflicts and resolutions

      For any two distinct priority levels p1, p2:

      Therefore the comparison p1 > p2 is well-defined for all pairs.

      Each priority level maps to exactly one SystemState condition.
