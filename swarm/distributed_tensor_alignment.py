Distributed Tensor Alignment — v7.3
Aligns S_full (unified_state_metric_tensor) across workers into ONE global coherence tensor.

Addresses the "Metric collapse risk" from v7.3 spec:
  S_full becomes inconsistent across partitions →
  we compute S_full per partition, then reconcile into ONE global tensor.
